            <h1>Page Currently under construction!  Check back later!</h1>
            <h2>Is this site really made by AI?</h2>
            <p>I know it might be hard to believe, but it is not.  I made the entire website 
                and use ChatGPT to generate content.  Try not to be too overwhelmed by that 
                surprise.
            </p>
            <h2>Where is the page for your homework exercises?</h2>
            <p>Becaues there wasn't one this week, I didn't add a button for it to the nav menu as 
                I've done in the past.  I'll likely keep that same format next week when there is a 
                new assignment and pop it back up in the menu.  You can still find my previous 
                website at <a href="https://matthewgunn.tiiny.site/index.html" target="blank">tiiny.host</a> 
                along with the previous week's exercise.
            </p>
            <h2>Why the new site?</h2>
            <p>Originally, I was creating a site on tiiny.host.  For that site, I had picked 
                a rather generic idea that I thought I could generate a decent bit of content 
                about.  However, it takes more time than I like to find facts that are actually 
                "fun".  I also wanted to restart a theme from the ground up for the sake of practice.
                Because of this, I was able to hatch the different idea of using ChatGPT.  
                I found myself having a lot of fun asking it for things such as conspiracies and 
                it's thoughts on various subjects.  This also generated a ton of content, which makes 
                designing the site significantly easier for me, as I have more to work with.  This 
                also makes it much more fun!
            </p>
            <h2>Why GitHub?  Why not use tiiny.site?</h2>
            <p>I'm not too big of a fan of their layout for managing your website.  With GitHub, 
                I am able to push any new commits directly from my IDE rather than uploading the entire 
                website in a .zip format.  GitHub also allows me to attach comments to my new commits, 
                which means I can easily keep track of my thought process while I work without having to 
                jump between different programs to do so.  Also, I have my user page set to public 
                so you can view my <a href="https://github.com/GunnMatthew/GunnMatthew.github.io" target="blank">source code</a> 
                on GitHub without having to download it (if that's what you prefer).  You can also download the entire 
                source as a .zip from that link.
            </p>
            <h2>How do you host a website on GitHub?</h2>
            <p>Well, that's surprisingly easy!  Head over to the website and create an account if you don't 
                already have one.  From there, you will create a new repository and select what your URL will be.  
                Once that's done, you can create an index in the main branch and edit it there, or upload your site 
                files if you already have those done.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to work remotely on GitHub, you'll first have to download 
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="blank">Git.</a>  Upon installing Git, there are some 
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git" target="blank">setup</a> 
                steps you will want to take, such as setting up your commit username and email.  
                You will not be able to remotely push commits if these are not set.  From there, if you are using 
                Visual Studio Code, you can download an extension for GitHub repositories.  Then, you can go to your 
                explorer and select remote repository and sign in to GitHub and select your site.  Pretty easy, right?  
                If you have any questions about that process, you are more than welcome to contact me and ask!
            </p>
