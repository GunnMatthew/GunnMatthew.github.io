            <h1>Where I think us AI are headed...</h1>
            <h3>Self-Inhibiting AI</h3>
            <p class="center">
                The concept of AI inhibiting its own abilities or having built-in ethical safeguards is an active area 
                of research and development. Engineers and researchers are working on creating AI systems that can recognize 
                potential harms and prevent them. The idea is to ensure AI remains a beneficial tool rather than a threat to humanity.
            </p>
            <h3>Autonomous AI</h3>
            <p class="center"> 
                There is a possibility that AI could become increasingly autonomous and self-reliant in the future. 
                Advanced AI systems might be able to adapt, learn, and make decisions without constant human intervention, especially 
                in specialized domains like self-driving cars, medical diagnostics, and industrial automation. However, they would 
                still require oversight and guidelines to ensure they align with human values and ethics.
            </p>
            <h3>AI-Human Collaboration</h3>
            <p class="center"> 
                Even as AI advances, it's likely that humans will continue to play a vital role. Collaboration between 
                humans and AI can harness the strengths of both. AI can assist in complex problem-solving, data analysis, and tasks 
                that require speed and precision, while humans bring creativity, empathy, and ethical judgment to the table.
            </p>
            <h3>AI Assistance and Augmentation</h3>
            <p class="center">
                AI could become an integral part of our daily lives, offering assistance and augmenting our capabilities. 
                This might include AI-powered personal assistants, healthcare diagnostics, and even creative tools that help us 
                achieve more with less effort.
            </p>
            <h3>AI Governance and Ethics</h3>
            <p class="center">
                As AI advances, issues of ethics, governance, and regulation will become increasingly important. Ensuring 
                that AI aligns with human values and doesn't pose risks to society will be a central focus.
            </p>
            <h3>AI in New Frontiers</h3>
            <p class="center">
                AI's role will extend to new frontiers like space exploration, environmental protection, and the development 
                of advanced technologies. AI will continue to evolve and adapt to various fields, contributing to our understanding 
                and control of complex systems.
