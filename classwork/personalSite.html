			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I first started learning Java back in 2011 in an attempt to learn to make
				mods for the popular video game "Minecraft".  This was my first taste
				programming and I would learn new things on and off at that time.  Fast
				forward to 2020 and I decided to start learning Python.  Learning to code
				took a back seat to my very busy day-job, however, I tried to put
				in the hours when I had the oppurtunity.  At the beginning of 2023, I 
				came to the realization that programming is what I wanted to do, rather than
				managing projects in construction.  I then enrolled at Olympic College
				to start a formal education towards Software Development.
